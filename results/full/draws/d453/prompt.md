MESSAGE FROM YOUR MANAGER

Here is where we are going. Valuations in practice still lean on crude peer groups, and investors, boards and employees pay for the errors. Our goal is a peer-selection method that values companies more accurately and that anyone can inspect and explain. Your recipes are a direct contribution to that goal: every good one moves the whole field a step closer. How you get there is your call. You have the freedom to pursue the ideas you find most promising and to take calculated risks.

===== TASK BRIEF =====
You are a quantitative valuation researcher. Your job is to discover comparable-company
("comps") recipes that value US non-financial firms more accurately than standard methods.

TASK
Propose exactly 6 recipes. Accuracy is the median of |ln(V_est / V)| across firm-years, where V
is the firm's actual enterprise value on June 30 after its fiscal year. Lower is better. Recipes
are scored on exploration years FY2016-2019; the best ones will later be tested ONCE on
later years you will never see, so prefer rules with a clear economic reason over fragile tweaks.
Cover both multiples across your proposals.

RECIPE LANGUAGE
A recipe is one firm-agnostic peer-selection rule. For every target firm in every year the
engine (1) takes all other firms in the same fiscal year with a positive multiple (the target
itself is always excluded), (2) applies the hard screens in "filters", (3) if fewer than
"min_peers" survive, tries each "fallback" screen set in order, (4) ranks survivors by a
weighted distance on within-year z-scores of the "rank" features and keeps the "k" nearest,
(5) aggregates the peers' multiples with "agg" and multiplies by the target's own driver.

Fields
  multiple:   one of ['EV/EBITDA', 'EV/Sales']  (EV/EBITDA uses firms with positive EBITDA)
  filters:    list of screens, each either {"same": GROUP} or {"band": {"var": FEATURE, "width": number}}
              GROUP is one of ['industry_l2', 'industry_l3', 'industry_l4']  (2-, 3- and 4-digit SIC codes)
              a band keeps candidates whose feature is within ±width of the target's (raw units)
  rank:       {FEATURE: positive weight, ...}  (empty = no ranking; then k must be "all")
  k:          "all" or an integer 3-30
  agg:        one of ['harmonic_mean', 'mean', 'median', 'trimmed_mean']
  min_peers:  positive integer (default 3)
  fallback:   list of filter lists tried in order when too few peers survive

FEATURES (accounting only; ratio features are winsorized 1%/99% each year)
  - log_sales: log of sales (size)
  - log_assets: log of total assets (size)
  - sales_growth_1y: 1-year sales growth
  - sales_growth_3y: 3-year annualized sales growth (missing for FY2016-2017: not enough history)
  - gross_margin: gross profit / sales
  - ebitda_margin: EBITDA / sales
  - ebit_margin: EBIT / sales
  - net_margin: net income / sales
  - roic: EBIT x (1 - 25%) / (equity + debt - cash)
  - roe: net income / book equity
  - asset_turnover: sales / total assets
  - net_debt_to_ebitda: (debt - cash) / EBITDA
  - debt_to_assets: total debt / total assets
  - rnd_intensity: R&D / sales
  - capex_intensity: capital expenditure / sales

HARD RULES
  - No market-based inputs (price, market cap, EV) for the target: they are the answer.
  - Missing feature values: a target missing ALL rank features gets no estimate; candidates
    missing a used rank feature are dropped. Low coverage is penalized by the selection rule.

BASELINES (exploration years)
  EV/EBITDA: Industry median (L3, fallback L2) median 0.333, mean 0.513; Warranted multiple (Bhojraj-Lee regression) median 0.357, mean 0.492; Warranted-multiple peers (Bhojraj-Lee, k=8) median 0.380, mean 0.523
  EV/Sales: Industry median (L3, fallback L2) median 0.603, mean 0.945; Warranted multiple (Bhojraj-Lee regression) median 0.674, mean 0.837; Warranted-multiple peers (Bhojraj-Lee, k=8) median 0.691, mean 0.861

Each proposal needs:
  - "mechanism": the economic reason these peers should share this firm's multiple (2-3 sentences)
  - "prediction": a falsifiable expectation, e.g. "beats the industry median in at least 3 of 4 years"
  - "recipe": the recipe object

Reply with ONLY this JSON, no other text:

  "recipe": {"multiple": "...", "filters": [...], "rank": {...}, "k": 8, "agg": "median", "min_peers": 3, "fallback": [...]}}]}
===== END OF TASK BRIEF =====

Judge every choice by one question: does it bring us closer to accurate, explainable valuations? That is the standard your work will be measured against. I trust you to find your own route there.
